# roommate-app

This was my first big Angular application that used Firebase to persist the app's state.

This is an application that I created so that my roommates and I could keep track of chores with busy schedules. Most specifically, we needed a way to figure out who fed the dog, without texting each other twice a day "did anyone feed Dexter?". We were also trying to train our dog with a trainer coming by frequently. 

This was mostly a "feed the dog" app, where I pictured one of us feeding the dog, pressing a little dog bowl on the phone, and of us all keeping track.

If were to recreate the application, I would restructure the folders to reflect individual components. A lot the early tutorials around Angular 1.x recommended using folders to hold all of your services, directives, etc., but this approach soon became overtaken by the component-ized approach.
