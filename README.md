This has an MIT License.

This was my first big Javascript application, put together from start to end. I used the AngularJS framework and a Firebase backend to store data. I enjoyed using both Angular and Firebase. I had done a few Angular tutorials and had I gotten a good feel for it. 

This is an application that I created so that my roommates and I could keep track of chores with busy schedules. We were all leaving a different times of the day, staying away about half of the time, we had a dog to take care of and plenty of home repairs concurrently. We needed a way to figure out who fed the dog, without doing a twice-a-day "Did anyone feed Dexter?", "No", "Okay cool, I'll feed him". We were also trying to train our dog with a trainer coming by frequently. This was mostly a "feed the dog" app, where I pictured one of us feeding the dog, pressing a little dog bowl on the phone, and of us all keeping track. I added a simple to-do list, a chat function, and an a few bootstrap colors we could choose from to identify ourselves. Gets the job done.

Recreating this program, I would do a few things different. First, I would have put factories and controllers that worked together in the same folder. Although this may largely due to TextMate, I found myself spending way to long looking up and down folders for files that spoke Angular to each other. I would organize by ones that have dependencies with each other, or the html partial with its controller. This is probably Angular's modularity at play. I also only began to get started creating my own directives toward the end. I think a lot of my factory/service functionality could have been transported to directive-land. I look forward to learning more about creating directives in my next program. I have been looking into a lot of frameworks and ReactJS seems interesting. I'd like to try out sometime.
